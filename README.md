### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I develop a variety of things for web and work with diverse web technologies.

- **Strong Fundamentals**: Skilled in building clean layouts with vanilla CSS and interactive features with vanilla JavaScript.
- **WordPress Expertise**: Extensive experience in crafting custom WordPress themes and plugins.
- **Full-Stack Proficiency**: From LAMP stack websites to modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte, I've worked with a wide range of technologies.
- **MERN & Modern Stacks**: I primarily focus on MERN stack development and leverage full-stack frameworks like Next.js and SvelteKit for development.
- **Design to Code Expertise**: I can seamlessly translate designs from tools like Figma into pixel-perfect, Tailwind CSS-powered front-ends.
